Hello World

I am amazing.

It looks like you have to double enter if you want the changes in preview changes to take
I guess it makes grouping text alittle easier but I'm sure there is a way to remove this feature.

I made a mistake and edited the master branch but I was able to complete the merge request so I guess it worked out :)
